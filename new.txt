To be fair, none of those things are bad things. That’s why I also agree that it’s important to be a “good boy”.
Most people around me would think if I am somewhere inside the “good boy” spectrum. Well, my enemies would not be agree though. And most of the times, I become my own enemy. But let’s get through it later.
To be honest, I never consider myself as a good boy (read: smart, polite, etc) nor feel very proud of it.
Then if I were asked — so why do I keep doing those “good boy” things — , I would most likely answer: Because this value has already been taught to me since I was young, and I haven’t found anything bad on it.
Had I found something bad, I would have probably challenged myself too.
